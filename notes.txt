From Cutting Surface (n,g) to min-Graph:
	Graph must have same Euler char as surface,
	Must have a cyclic ordering where the number of directed cycles equal to number of boundary components,
	and must satisfy minimality condition

	Idea: think about starting with a single directed loop and then "laminating" the rest of the cycles inside while at each stage preserving the minimality condition.

	Note: A rotation system yields a disconnected digraph with the right number of cycles by splitting edges and writing both 


Things to do:
- Implement
- Extend to n-cuts on k-torus
- Disconnected graphs
